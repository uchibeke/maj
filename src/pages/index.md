  title: Why me?
  description: >-
    I'm a Nigerian-born, Los Angeles-based filmmaker. I discovered filmmaking
    was what I wanted to do right from high school when I was the filmmaker and
    photographer of the Entertainment Club of my high school, which I was part
    of. 
description: >-
  I work in Fashion, editorial, portrait, commercial/industrial, fine arts and
  street. I use a blend of technical skills and an artistic eye to take pictures
  of people, places, landscapes, food, name it. I can work as a fine artist,
  wedding and event photographer, or in whatever capacity I am needed.

        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
